Replication of the results and graphs can be done by running first "main.m" and next "graphs".

Folder "raw" contains the BLP automobile industry data and the IV variables.

Folder "int" contains two output files from "main.m" (files "pas.csv" and "dss.csv") and two manually constructed files (files "res_est.csv" and "res_ds.csv").

Folder "fig" contains all three graphs.
